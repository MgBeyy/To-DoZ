# To-DoZ - A simple, user-friendly, and modern interface Todo application

This is a basic Todo application developed for a programming lesson at my school using the Python programming language. The application consists of two main files: one for the model and the other for the interface.

## Files

### 1. Todo Functions File (function.py)
The `function.py` file contains the core functions and logic for managing Todo tasks. These functions include adding tasks, marking tasks as complete, and removing task.

### 2. Interface File (interface.py)
The `interface.py` file is responsible for the graphical user interface (GUI) of the program. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for interacting with the ToDoZ application. Note that this file will be further detailed in the future.

## Usage

To use the ToDoZ application, follow these steps:
1. Run the `interface.py` file.
2. Interact with the GUI to add, complete, or prioritize tasks.


## Feedback
If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the development.

Happy organizing your tasks with ToDoZ!
